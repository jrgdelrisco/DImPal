# DImPal

Digital Image Processing Algorithms using .Net Core

The solution will consists on three projects:

## DIPAlgorithms

A C# library with digital image processing algorithms implementations.

## PrototypingConsole

A console application with CLI capabilities to run and test the algorithms.

## DigitalImageProcessingAlgorithms

An ASP.NET Core MVC web application that shows up all the implementations results.

## Installation

1. Clone or Download the **DImPal** project.
2. Run `npm install` command in **DigitalImageProcessingAlgorithms** directory.
3. Run `dotnet restore` command in **DImPal** directory.

For the web application go to **DigitalImageProcessingAlgorithms** and run `dotnet run` and follow console instructions.

For the console application project run `dotnet run image_file_path.jpg` inside **PrototypingConsole** directory.
